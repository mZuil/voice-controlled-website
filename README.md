# Voice Controlled Website - Frontend

Practical example of a booking-transport website that can be controlled by voice, in Spanish. To make it work, the voice-control project has to be executed in the background as well. Developers have to set a different prompt for each page of the website to make it work.

## Content of the project
- Speech-to-text: to transcribe what the user says.
- OpenAI usage: to send the HTML with which the user can interact, and the voice command the user says.
  
## How to execute project
```
ng serve --open
```
